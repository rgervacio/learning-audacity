# Export a project

Exporting a project allows you to save your project as a specific audio file format, such as an .mp3 or .wav format.

!!! note 

        All tracks in an exported project get <a href="/learning-audacity/editing-a-project/mix-tracks/">mixed</a> together as a single track. Before exporting the project, ensure that you’re finished editing and satisfied with the end result.

!!! tip

        If the tracks have varying volume levels, you should <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-overall-volume-level/#normalize-audio">normalize</a> them before exporting the project to ensure that the overall volume is more consistent.

## Export an audio selection

To export an audio selection:

1. On the Tools toolbar, click the **Selection tool**.

1. Select the section of audio that you want to export.

2. Go to **File** \> **Export** \> **Export Selected Audio**.

3. In the dialog box, select the folder where you want to save the audio file.

4. In the **File name** box, enter the file name.

5. In the **Save as type** dropdown menu, select the file format.

    !!! tip 

            If having a small file size is important, select a compressed file format, such as .mp3 or .aac. Compressed file formats produce a smaller file size and still retain good audio quality. If you’re not limited by file size, select an uncompressed file format, such as .wav or .aiff. Uncompressed file formats produce a larger file size but also result in the best audio quality.

    !!! note

            To export a project as an .m4a, .aac, or .wma file, you must first install the <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/faq_installing_the_ffmpeg_import_export_library.html" target="_blank">FFMPEG library</a> in Audacity.

6. Under **Format Options**, select your preferred format settings.

    !!! note

            The default format settings work well for most projects.

7. Click **Save**.

8. In the dialog box, enter the audio file’s metadata information (optional).

        Metadata describes information about the audio file and appears when it’s opened in a media player app.

9. Click **OK**.
