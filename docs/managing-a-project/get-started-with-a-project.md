    !!! note  
     
            If the imported audio’s waveform isn’t centered at the 0.0 line on the Vertical scale, you should <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-overall-volume-level#normalize-audio">normalize the track</a> to remove the DC offset before editing and applying effects. DC offset can result in clipping, distortion, and popping sounds.
