# Manage tracks

Managing tracks involves adding, naming, moving, collapsing, and deleting tracks and changing track appearance.
</br>


## Add a track

Adding a track allows you to create a blank track, which you can use to start a new recording, move existing clips, annotate audio, or adjust speed and pitch.

To add a track:

1. Go to **Tracks** \> **Add New**.

1. Select the type of track to add:

    - To record in mono, select **Mono Track**.

    - To record in stereo, select **Stereo Track**.

    - To label audio, select **Label Track**.

    - To adjust speed and pitch changes, select **Time Track**.

## Name a track and clip

Naming a track allows you to identify and better organize the tracks in your project.

### Name a track

To name a track:

1. On the Track control panel, click the **Track dropdown menu**.

2. In the **clip handle**, enter the clip name.

3. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> .

<br/>

## Move a track

Moving a track allows you to change a track’s position in the project window.

To move a track:

1. On the Track control panel, click the **Track dropdown menu**.

    <img src="/learning-audacity/assets/images/Track Control Panel - Track dropdown menu.png" />

1. Select where you want to move the track:

    - To move the selected track above the track that’s currently above it, select **Move Track Up**.

    - To move the selected track below the track that’s currently below it, select **Move Track Down**.

    - To move the selected track above all other tracks in the project, select **Move Track to Top**.

    - To move the selected track below all other tracks in the project, select **Move Track to Bottom**.
 
 <br/> 

## Collapse a track

Collapsing a track allows you to minimize a track’s waveform in the project window.

To collapse a track:

- On the Track control panel, click the **upwards arrow button**.

    !!! note
    
        A collapsed track will still play during playback if it’s not muted.

<br/>

To expand a track:

- On the Track control panel, click the **downwards arrow button**.

<br/>

## Delete a track

Deleting a track allows you to erase an existing track from a project.

To delete a track:

- On the Track control panel, click the **X button**.

<br/>

## Change track size

Changing track size allows you to extend and condense the track contents.

To change track size:

1.	Hover over the **track’s bottom border** so that the cursor turns into a **resize cursor**.

    <img src="/learning-audacity/assets/images/Change Track Size - Resize cursor.png" />

2.	Drag the **track’s bottom border** until you reach the desired size:

    - To increase the track size, drag the bottom border down.

    - To decrease the track size, drag the bottom border up.

    !!! note

        Changing the track size will also change the size of the Vertical scale. To make the Vertical scale easier to read, increase the track size.

<br/>

## Change waveform color

Changing waveform color allows you to change a track’s waveform colour to blue, red, green, or black. This is useful for identifying and organizing different voices, instruments, or songs in a project.

To change waveform color:

1. On the Track control panel, click the **Track dropdown menu**.

    <img src="/learning-audacity/assets/images/Track Control Panel - Track dropdown menu.png" />

2. Select **Wave Color**.

3. Select the waveform color:

    - To change the color to blue, select **Instrument 1**.

        <img src="/learning-audacity/assets/images/Waveform Color - Instrument 1.png"  />


    
    - To change the color to red, select **Instrument 2**.

        <img src="/learning-audacity/assets/images/Waveform Color - Instrument 2.png" />

        
    - To change the color to green, select **Instrument 3**.

        <img src="/learning-audacity/assets/images/Waveform Color - Instrument 3.png" />


    - To change the color to black, select **Instrument 4**.
    
        <img src="/learning-audacity/assets/images/Waveform Color - Instrument 4.png" /><br/>

    !!! note

        If you move a clip into a different track with a different waveform color, the clip will still retain its waveform color.
