- **Upwards arrow button** collapses the track’s waveform in the project window.

- **Select button** selects the entire track.

<br/><br/>

## Vertical scale

<img src="../assets/images/Vertical Scale.png" />

The **Vertical scale** measures the waveform amplitude in an audio track and the speed and pitch in a time track. Vertical scales differ in appearance depending on the track type.

In an **audio track**, the Vertical scale shows the waveform amplitude levels. It measures audio loudness and controls the track’s vertical zoom settings.

Mono tracks contain one Vertical scale, and stereo tracks contain two Vertical scales (one for each channel).

<img src="../assets/images/Vertical Scale - Labelled.png" />

<br/>

Right-clicking the **Vertical scale** shows options to change the audio track’s scale settings and vertical zoom levels.

<img src="../assets/images/Vertical Scale - Right click.png" />

By default, the Vertical scale’s measurement setting is set to **Linear (amp)** or a linear scale with amplitude values. 1.0 indicates the maximum positive signal value, and -1.0 indicates the maximum negative signal value. If the waveform exceeds either 1.0 or -1.0, audio clipping or distortion may occur.

The **Logarithmic (dB)** setting measures using a logarithmic scale with decibel values, and the **Linear (dB)** setting measures using a linear scale with decibel values. If the waveform exceeds 0 dB on either end of the scale, audio clipping or distortion may occur.

<img src="../assets/images/Vertical Scale - Different units.png" />

<br/>

In a **time track**, the Vertical scale shows the playback speed and pitch levels. It measures the audio's speed and pitch, which are controlled using the time warp line.

<img src="../assets/images/Time Track - Vertical scale.png" />

Right-clicking the **Vertical scale** shows options to change the time track’s scale (either to a **Linear scale** or **Logarithmic scale**) and speed limit range.

<img src="../assets/images/Time Track - Vertical scale - Right click.png" />

By default, the Vertical scale’s measurement setting is set to **Linear scale**. The 100 point indicates the normal audio speed (100%). The number above 100 is the upper speed limit (maximum speed change allowed), and the number below 100 is the lower speed limit (minimum speed change allowed). To change the upper and lower speed limits, select **Range**.

In a **label track**, the Vertical scale shows nothing.

<br/>

## Track

The **Track** is a project component that you can edit independently. A project can contain multiple tracks, which get combined as a single track after mixing or exporting.

In Audacity, there are three main types of tracks:

- <a href="#audio-track">Audio track</a>

    - Mono track

    - Stereo track

- <a href="#label-track">Label track</a>

- <a href="#time-track">Time track</a>
<br/>

### Audio track

An **audio track** shows audio data from an audio source, such as an individual instrument in a musical performance, voiceover in a podcast, or song in a mashup compilation. A project may contain multiple tracks, such as one for voiceover, a second for another voiceover, and a third for background music.

Audio tracks contain one or more **clips** that show audio data represented as **waveforms**. Clips can be split into smaller clips that you can edit independently or move elsewhere in the same track or in a different track.

<br/>

#### Mono track

A **mono track** is an audio track that shows a waveform in one channel. Audio in the single channel plays evenly in the left and right speakers or headphones.

<img src="../assets/images/Mono Track - Labelled.png" />

<br/>

#### Stereo track

A **stereo track** is an audio track that shows a waveform in two separate channels: a left and right channel. Audio in the left channel plays in the left speaker or headphone, and audio in the right channel plays in the right speaker or headphone.

Depending on how the track was recorded, the waveforms in the two channels may differ slightly.

<img src="../assets/images/Stereo Track - Labelled.png" />

<br/>


### Label track

A **label track** shows annotations for specific points or sections of audio. You can use label tracks to create notes and navigate through the project more easily.

<img src="../assets/images/Label Track - Labelled.png" />

A **point label** annotates a specific point of audio, and a **region label** annotates a specific section of audio.

<br/>

### Time track

A **time track** shows speed and pitch changes that affect all tracks in the project. You can use a time track to gradually increase or decrease speed and pitch.

<img src="../assets/images/Time Track - Labelled.png" />

The **time warp line** controls the speed and pitch level. The 100 point on the time track’s Vertical scale indicates the normal audio speed (100%).

A **control point** adjusts a specific point on the time warp line.

Adjusting the **time warp line** or a **control point** above or below 100 changes the speed and pitch:

- To increase the speed and pitch, drag the time warp line or control point above 100.

- To decrease the speed and pitch, drag the time warp line or control point below 100.

<br/><br/>

## Snapping toolbar

<img src="../assets/images/Snapping Toolbar.png" />

The **Snapping toolbar** contains functions for snapping the cursor or current audio selection.

<img src="../assets/images/Snapping Toolbar - Labelled.png" />

The **Snap checkbox** enables and disables the ability to snap the cursor or audio selection to the nearest millisecond or other selected time format. By default, snapping is disabled.

The **dropdown menu** shows options to change the time format. It's enabled when the Snap checkbox is checked.

<img src="../assets/images/Snapping Toolbar - Dropdown Menu.png" />

<br/><br/>

## Time toolbar

<img src="../assets/images/Time Toolbar.png" />

The **Time toolbar** shows the current audio position on the Timeline. During recording and playback, the display field shows the Play/Record head’s current position and timestamp. Outside of recording and playback, the display field shows the cursor’s current position and timestamp in the track.

Clicking the **downwards arrow** beside the display field shows a dropdown menu with options to change the time format.

<img src="../assets/images/Time Toolbar - Drop-down menu.png" />

<br/><br/>

## Selection toolbar

<img src="../assets/images/Selection Toolbar.png" />

The **Selection toolbar** shows the start and end times of the current audio selection.

<img src="../assets/images/Selection Toolbar - Labelled.png" />

The **start time display field** shows the selection’s current start time, and the **end time display field** shows the selection’s current end time. Clicking the **downwards arrow** beside either display field shows a dropdown menu with options to change the time format.

<img src="../assets/images/Selection Toolbar - Dropdown Menu.png" />

The **cogwheel button** shows a dropdown menu with options to change the selection display field’s format.

<img src="../assets/images/Play-at-Speed Slider.png" />

The **Play-at-speed toolbar** controls playback speed.

<img src="../assets/images/Play-at-Speed Toolbar - Labelled.png" />

The **Play-at-speed button** plays audio at the speed indicated by the slider.

The **slider** changes the playback speed:

- To increase the playback speed, drag the slider to the right.

- To decrease the playback speed, drag the slider to the left.

Double-clicking the slider shows a dialog box with a field box and slider for adjusting the playback speed more precisely.


<img src="../assets/images/Play-at-Speed Toolbar - Dialog Box.png" />

<br/><br/>

## Status bar

<img src="../assets/images/Status Bar.png" />

The **Status bar** shows the project’s playback and recording status. It also shows information about Audacity’s GUI whenever you hover the cursor over a button, meter, or slider.

During playback, the Status bar shows the project status and actual rate, which is the active sample rate at which Audacity communicates to the sound card or audio interface.

<img src="../assets/images/Status Bar - Playback.png" />

During recording, the Status bar shows the project status, amount of free disk space left for recording, and actual rate, which is the active sample rate at which the sound card or audio interface communicates to Audacity.

<img src="../assets/images/Status Bar - Recording.png" />

<br/>
