## Change playback level

Changing the playback level allows you to increase and decrease the output signal volume of the entire project. This is useful for preventing the playback audio from getting too loud and clipping.

To change playback level:

- On the Playback meter toolbar, drag the **slider**:

    - To increase the playback level, drag the slider to the right.

    - To decrease the playback level, drag the slider to the left.

    !!! note

        Adjusting the Playback level slider only changes the project’s playback volume in Audacity. It won’t change any actual waveform data or affect an exported project’s volume level. To change the overall volume, <a href="/learning-audacity/editing-a-project/adjust-track-gain/">adjust the gain</a> or use the <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-overall-volume-level/#amplify-audio">Amplify</a>, <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-overall-volume-level/#normalize-audio">Normalize</a>, or <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-overall-volume-level/#compress-audio">Compressor</a> effect instead.
