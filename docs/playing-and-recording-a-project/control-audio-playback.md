# Control audio playback

Controlling audio playback involves using the Transport toolbar to play, loop, pause, stop, or skip audio.

        Press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> .

    !!! note

        Clicking Play or pressing <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> again will replay the beginning of the track or audio selection. To continue playback without jumping back to the beginning, pause and unpause the audio instead.

    !!! tip

        To play a specific part of a project without pausing, click the part on the Timeline where you want to start playback. To select a specific track to play and mute all other tracks in a project, click the **Solo** button on the selected track's Track control panel.

        Adjusting the Play-at-speed slider only changes the project’s playback speed in Audacity. It won’t change any actual waveform data. To change audio speed, use the <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-tempo-speed-and-pitch/#change-overall-speed">Change speed</a> or <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-tempo-speed-and-pitch/#change-overall-tempo">Change tempo</a> effect instead.
