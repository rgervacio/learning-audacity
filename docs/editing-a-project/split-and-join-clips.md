# Split and join clips

Splitting and joining clips allow you to break up and merge clips inside a track.
<br/>

## Split clips

Splitting clips allows you to break up a clip into smaller clips that you can play, edit, and move independently.

To split clips:

1. On the Tools toolbar, click the **Selection tool**.

2. Select the point or section of the track where you want to split audio.

3. Go to **Edit** \> **Audio Clips**.

4. Split the audio:

    - To keep the clips in the same track, select **Split**.

        !!! solid-keyboard "Shortcut"        
        
            Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> .

        _Clips split in the same track are divided by clip boundaries._<br/><br/>

    - To move and insert a clip in a new track, select **Split New**.

        _Clips split in a new track appear below the original track._<br/><br/>

        !!! tip 

            You can <a href="/learning-audacity/managing-a-project/manage-tracks/#name-a-clip-inside-a-track">name clips</a> to identify specific sections of audio and better organize your project.

<br/>

## Join clips

Joining clips allows you to merge multiple clips together as a larger clip.

To join clips:

1. On the Tools toolbar, click the **Selection tool**.

2. Select the section of the track that contains the clip boundaries where you want to merge the clips together.

    !!! note

        Joining clips without a waveform between them will replace the gap with a flat waveform (silence). To join clips without inserting a flat waveform, <a href="/learning-audacity/editing-a-project/move-and-align-audio/#move-a-clip">move the clips</a> next to each other until they snap together.

3. Go to **Edit** \> **Audio Clips** \> **Join**.

    _Clip boundaries disappear after joining clips._
