## Trim audio

Trimming audio allows you to hide and prevent the end of a waveform from being played during playback. Unlike deleting, trimming doesn’t completely erase audio information in a track.

### Trim a clip

To trim a clip:

1. Hover over the upper half of the **clip’s border** so that the cursor turns into a **resize cursor**.

    !!! tip
    
        Audacity remembers the audio information contained in a trimmed clip. To untrim a clip, drag the **clip's border** outwards to reveal the rest of the waveform.
