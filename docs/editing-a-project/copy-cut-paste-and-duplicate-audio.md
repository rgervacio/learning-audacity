## Copy and paste audio

Copying and pasting audio involve replicating an audio selection and inserting it elsewhere in the same track, in another track in the same project, or in a different project.

To copy and paste audio:

1. On the Tools toolbar, click the **Selection tool**.

        Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> .

4. Click the part of the track where you want to paste the audio.

5. Go to **Edit** \> **Paste**.

    !!! solid-keyboard "Shortcut"

## Cut and paste audio

Cutting and pasting audio involve removing an audio selection and inserting it elsewhere in the same track, in another track in the same project, or in a different project.

To cut and paste audio:

1. On the Tools toolbar, click the **Selection tool**.

    !!! note 
    
        Selecting **Cut** or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> will shift the remaining audio along the Timeline. This could make the affected track out of sync with other tracks in the project. 

        <br/>Split cutting will leave an empty gap in the track instead of shifting audio. To split cut, go to **Edit** \> **Remove Special** \> **Split Cut** or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> .
