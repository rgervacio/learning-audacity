# Adjust track gain

Adjusting track gain using the **Gain slider** allows you to increase and decrease a track’s volume level relative to all other tracks in the project.

!!! note
    
    Adjusting the gain affects the entire track and won’t change any actual waveform data until you <a href="/learning-audacity/editing-a-project/mix-tracks/">mix the track</a> or <a href="/learning-audacity/managing-a-project/export-a-project/#export-an-entire-project">export the project</a>. To edit specific sections of the track or change the waveform data and overall volume without mixing or exporting, use the <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-overall-volume-level/#amplify-audio">Amplify</a>, <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-overall-volume-level/#normalize-audio">Normalize</a>, or <a href="/learning-audacity/applying-common-audio-effects/change-overall-volume-level/#compress-audio">Compressor</a> effect instead.

    !!! tip

        To adjust the gain more precisely, press and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> , and then drag or double-click the **Gain slider** and enter a specific decibel value in the dialog box.

    !!! tip

        Whenever you increase the gain, <a href="/learning-audacity/playing-and-recording-a-project/monitor-audio/#monitor-playback-level">monitor the playback level</a> in the **Playback level meter** to ensure that the audio doesn’t clip.
